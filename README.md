A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

Key points about binary trees:

Node Structure: Each node in a binary tree contains a piece of data and references or pointers to its left and right children nodes.
Root Node: The topmost node in the tree is called the root node. It's the starting point for traversing or accessing other nodes in the tree.
Child Nodes: Nodes in a binary tree can have zero, one, or two children. A node with no children is called a leaf node.
Binary Search Tree (BST): In a special type of binary tree called a binary search tree, nodes are organized such that the left child of a node contains a value smaller than the node's value, and the right child contains a value greater than the node's value. This organization makes searching, insertion, and deletion efficient in BSTs.
